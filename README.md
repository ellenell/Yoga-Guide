## <a name="wireframes"></a>Wire Frames
For my index page, I will have listed the following:

* Beginner Yoga
* Intermediate Yoga
* Advanced Yoga

The user will be able to select which one they want.

Then for each page, I will list 5-10 poses that fit into each category. The user can click on the pose names.

Then in my show pages, for example for the downward facing dog pose below, I will describe how to do it, how it helps your back muscles and legs. I can also note substitutes if you cannot do the full pose. It will look like the below:
